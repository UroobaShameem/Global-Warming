    <h1>Global Warming:A Major Concern</h1>
    <div id="cover"><img src="https://www.s-ge.com/sites/default/files/styles/sge_header_lg/public/article/images/epfl_unil_climact_945x430_0.jpg?itok=G20Xw5rh"></div>
    <p>Global warming is the phenomenon of a gradual increase in the temperature near the earth’s surface.
         This phenomenon has been observed over the past one or two centuries. 
         This change has disturbed the climatic pattern of the earth. <br>
         There are several causes of global warming, which have a negative effect on humans, plants and animals.
         These causes may be natural or might be the outcome of human activities.</p>

            <div class="name"><h3>Deforestation</h3></div>
            <div class="desc"><p>Plants are the main source of oxygen.Forests are being depleted for many domestic and commercial purposes.
                 This has led to an environmental imbalance, thereby giving rise to global warming.</p></div>

            <div class="name"><h3>Industrial<br>Development</h3></div>
            <div class="desc"><p>With the advent of industrialization, the temperature of the earth has been increasing rapidly. 
                The harmful emissions from the factories add to the increasing temperature of the earth. </p></div>

            <div class="name"><h3>Use Of<br>Vehicles</h3></div>
            <div class="desc"><p>Vehicles burn fossil fuels which emit a large amount of carbon dioxide and other toxins into the atmosphere resulting in a temperature increase.
            </p></div>

    <h2>Effects Of Global Warming</h2>
    <div class="main">
        <div class="cont">
            <div id="img4"></div>
            <div class="name"><h3>Rise In <br>Temperature</h3></div>
            <div class="desc"><p>Global warming has led to an incredible increase in earth’s temperature. 
                Since 1880, the earth’s temperature has increased by ~1 degrees. 
                This has resulted in an increase in the melting of glaciers, which have led to an increase in the sea level.
            </p></div>

        <div class="cont">
            <div id="img5"></div>
            <div class="name"><h3>Climate<br>Change</h3></div>
            <div class="desc"><p>Global warming has led to a change in climatic conditions. 
                There are droughts at some places and floods at some. This climatic imbalance is the result of global warming.
            </p></div>

            <div id="img6"></div>
            <div class="name"><h3>Loss Of<br>Natural Habitat</h3></div>
            <div class="desc"><p>A global shift in the climate leads to the loss of habitats of several plants and animals. 
                In this case, the animals need to migrate from their natural habitat and many of them even become extinct.
                 This is yet another major impact of global warming on biodiversity.
